### Description

This petri net was generated by [PIPE 5.0.2](https://github.com/sarahtattersall/PIPE/releases)

| Event                 | Pre-condition                 | Post-condition                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| submit an article     | author                        | articles to be reviewed       |
| check articles        | articles to be reviewed       | articles to be reviewed       |
| edit articles         | articles to be reviewed       | articles to be reviewed       |
| show to chief editors | articles to be reviewed       | chief editor                  |
| assign editors        | chief editor                  | editor A, editor B            |
| review articles       | editor A, editor B            | articles to be final reviewed |
| pass                  | articles to be final reviewed | passed articles               |
| refuse                | articles to be final reviewed | articles to be reviewed       |

Three tokens are needed for completing the business process:

* the author submits an article which will be accepted
  * author → articles to be reviewed → chief editor → editor A & editor B → articles to be final reviewed → passed articles
  * Events: submit an article, show to chief editors, assign editors, review articles, pass
* the author submits an article which will be refused
  * author → articles to be reviewed → chief editor → editor A & editor B → articles to be final reviewed → articles to be reviewed
  * Events: submit an article, show to chief editors, assign editors, review articles, refuse
* the author checks a submitted article and modifies it
  * articles to be reviewed → articles to be reviewed  → articles to be reviewed
  * Events: check articles, edit articles

It's obvious that the articles is the main value of the system. It must ensure the articles' quality and amount.   The more articles to be published, the more users to be drawn; the better articles to be published, the more authors to be drawn. This forms a  virtuous circle and that's why the main path, which contains all actors in the system, is **REVIEW**. Efficiency of editors and the chief editor coping with articles is the bottleneck, hence KPI depends on the chief editor and editors. To manage articles better, system should have good policies to store articles and tag them accurately.
